    Counting words
        a. Write a program to count the words of the given file. For simplicity we do not
        aim at extracting true words. Consider each token with more than 3 symbols
        a valid word.
        b. Write a program to solve it without concurrency, i.e., no threadd is required
        except the Main thread.
        c. Write another program (enhance the previous version) so that chunks of, say,
        300 lines will be assigned to one thread to count, the next 300 lines to
        another thread, etc.
        i. Make sure you join all the starting threads so that the Main thread
        waits for all of them to complete and then accumulate their results,
        which are the number of words in each chunk of 300 lines.
        d. Print the time taken by both approaches and see the differences.
